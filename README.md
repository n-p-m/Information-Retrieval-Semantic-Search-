* This Repo contains code for Information Retrieval with Semantic Search on Vector Database [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors) using Python.
* Information we are retrieving is the 200 articles that I scrapped as part of my MS project. 
* My Previous implementation used FAISS Index Vector Library which is not scalable for real life production level applications. Weaviate is open source Vector [databases](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) which works great for information retrieval and RAQ for LLM applications.
